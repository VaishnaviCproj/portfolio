    <!-- ✅ Project Overview -->
    <h4>Project Overview:</h4>
    <p>
        Designed a technology evaluation strategy to address a global retail leader’s issue of stockouts caused by inaccurate demand forecasting and fragmented inventory visibility. Over the course of the semester, analyzed its digital transformation efforts, identified operational bottlenecks, and developed OKRs to evaluate three emerging technologies. Ultimately, focused the final plan on piloting AI-enabled No-Touch Supply Chain Planning for one product category across two stores, aiming to assess its effectiveness in reducing stockouts, improving inventory responsiveness, and establishing a scalable framework for future automation.

    <!-- ✅ Key Contributions -->
    <h4>Key Contributions:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Problem Framing & Root Cause Analysis:</strong> Scoped the stockout challenge by linking customer dissatisfaction to demand volatility and lagging planning systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Technology Shortlisting & Justification:</strong> Evaluated 30+ emerging technologies based on relevance, maturity, and business fit. Shortlisted three, then selected AI-enabled no-touch planning for in-depth evaluation.</li>
        <li><strong>OKR & Pilot Design:</strong> Developed a 3-month pilot targeting a 10% stockout reduction, with success tracked through implementation rates, inventory audits, and comparison with baseline performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Deliverables & Evaluation Framework:</strong> Produced a comprehensive pilot plan including a data integration roadmap, recommendation tracker, stockout rate comparison analysis, and final stakeholder presentation.</li>
        <li><strong>Cost & Risk Planning:</strong> Proposed a $123,500 pilot budget and proactively addressed risks related to adoption, data access, and ROI, aligning project feasibility with the organization’s strategic and operational goals.</li>
    </ul>
